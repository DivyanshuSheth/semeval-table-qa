Then, it checks if the respondent intends to vote in the upcoming election by checking if the `How likely are you to vote in the forthcoming US Presidential election? Early Voting Open` column has any value. Finally, it returns the minimum value of the `Did you vote in the 2016 Presidential election?

If they voted, the function checks if their vote in the 2016 election (four years ago) is different from their vote in the upcoming election. If the vote is different, the function returns True, indicating that the respondent has shifted their voting preference from the 2016 election to the upcoming one.\n\nNote: The function is assuming that the respondents have changed their vote only if they did not vote in the 2016 election or if their vote in the 2016 election is different from their vote in the upcoming election. In practice, there may be other circumstances in which the respondent has shifted their voting preference, and the function may need to be adjusted to accommodate these variations.",

The `shape[0]` attribute of the resulting DataFrame returns the number of rows that meet the filter criteria.",
