Prompt used is:

You are an expert data scientist working at a large company. You have been tasked with writing a function that will gather insights from a dataset. The function should take a pandas DataFrame as input and return the requested information. 
Given the following input DataFrame columns, question, and expected return type, complete the function in one line.

Input DataFrame columns: {list_df_columns}
Question: {question}
Expected return type: {row_type}

Example format:
def answer(df: pd.DataFrame) -> float:
    df.columns = ['A', 'B', 'C']
    return ...

Write a single line of code to replace the ... that:
1. Uses the DataFrame 'df' as input
2. Returns the exact type specified in the return type
3. Solves the given question
4. Uses pandas operations efficiently
5. Avoids loops or multiple statements

The solution should be ONLY one line and use pandas vectorized operations when possible. 

Format your output as follows:
```json
{{
    "solution": "your one line of code here"
}}
```
